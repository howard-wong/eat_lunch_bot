# eat_lunch_bot
A telegram bot for lunch decision making.

Finding one out of hundreds of restaurants for lunch for a group of people is never an easy task. While direct election is a tyranny of the majority, and equal opportunities is not the best for the minority. Instead of electing the most popular restaurant, we are designing a bot to decrement the unfavor restaurants so as every opinions count in our decision making process. 

Let's enjoy our lunch.
